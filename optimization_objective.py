# After several motivational lectures, in a lecture titled "Collaborative Filtering Algorithm," at 1:10 Ng reveals
# his optimization objective for collaborative filtering. However, he then simplifies it by having x and theta be
# n-dimensional vectors (where n is the number of features), rather than n+1 dimensional vectors. This leads to a
# simplification discussed in the video about 5:45.

# In this file, we implement optimization_objective. (Ng calls it J.)


# As is so often the case in these optimization problems, I will make a function that returns optimization_objective,
# rather than defining optimization_objective directly. This is my way of encapsulating that the function is best
# defined with reviews in its enclosing scope. Globals are messy. Long argument lists are also messy.
# Closures allow us to avoid either of those messes.  Note there is very little cost
# to passing reviews around even if it is a very long list. Its semantic is pass-by-reference, not pass-by-copy.
